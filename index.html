                 <h2>The things i do during my free time</h2>
                  <p>
                    I really enjoy spending time with my family. Indeed we have the habit of going to the restaurant one a week. It is a nice way to spend time together and catch up on each others lives. I also really enjoy spending time with my friend and It is a nice way to destress.

                   <h2>Sport</h2>
                      <p>
                       I've always practiced a lot of sport during my childhood. For example I did gymnastics during 5 years. The year before i quit I had 6 hours of training a week and I also competed a few times.

                  <h2>My travels </h2>
                     <p>
                       I did not traveled that much in my life but I still had the opportunity to make some nice trips. Among them I went to Amsterdam where I had the chance to visit the famous "Anne frank's House". To have the nicest experience possible we decided to rent a houseboat wich was really fun. the trip was in february so It was really cold outside. Some channels were frozen and people were ice skating.
